Such an API call also returns a <b>records</b> field, which contains the number of records\n in the current page, the current page number and the total number of records.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn cases where the total number of records exceeds the number of records thus far retrieved, the <b>records</b> field will also\n contain a <b>cursor</b> field which can be used to access the next page of records. To retrieve the next page, repeat the API call with\n the <b>cursor</b> value as supplied by the previous API call. All other request inputs should remain the same.\n</p>\n<h2>Forward Compatibility</h2>\n\n<p>\nWhen coding a system to accept Gong data, take into account that Gong may, without prior warning, add fields to the JSON output.\n It is recommended to future proof your code so that it disregards all JSON fields you don't actually use.\n\n</p><p></p>","version":"V2","title":"Gong API"},"host":"127.0.0.1","basePath":"/","tags":[{"name":"Calls","description":"<h3>Gong’s “Calls” API endpoints allow you to:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nRequest calls details from Gong\n</li>\n<li>\nUpload new calls to Gong\n</li>\n<li>\nUpdate Gong Calls with new media\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The requested calls may contain the following call details:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Meta Data</b> (Basic details such as call date, title, call URL, etc)\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Parties</b> (A list of the call's participants)\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Media</b> (The media urls of the call)\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Content</b> (Analysis of the interaction content)\n<ul>\n<li>\nAction Items (A list of action items)\n</li>\n<li>\nStructure (A list of the agenda of each part of the call)\n</li>\n<li>\nTopics (A list of topics and their durations)\n</li>\n<li>\nTrackers (A list of trackers found in the call.

Upload your CRMs data to enable Gong to leverage your CRM data as part of its Revenue Intelligence solution.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>The CRM API enables Gong customers to upload their data to Gong as well as keep that data up to date - meaning changes to the CRM data are uploaded to Gong. Gong will associate communications (calls, emails, etc.) with the related CRM objects (e.g., Deals, Accounts, Contacts, Leads).</p><br>There are two kinds of upload:<ul>   <li>initial upload</li>   <li>incremental upload</li></ul><h3>Initial upload</h3><p>Performed the first time the CRM connects to Gong.</p><ul>    <li>All relevant objects are uploaded to Gong including the relevant data fields.</li></ul><h3>Incremental upload</h3><p>After the initial upload has been completed, you should send regular incremental data updates to Gong.</p><ul>    <li>The CRM only uploads objects that were changed since the previous incremental upload.</li>    <li>During an incremental upload:        <ul>            <li>Objects that already exist in Gong are updated.</li>            <li>Objects that did not exist are created.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul><ul class='public-api-info'>    <li>Initial upload and incremental upload use the same upload API.</li>    <li>Each uploaded object is identified by an ID. The object ID is a mandatory string and unique per object type.</li>    <li>The same object should always be sent with the same ID.</li>    <li>IDs are also used to link between objects. For example, a deal object has an ownerId field which is the object ID of the user that owns that deal.</li></ul><h2>Recommendations</h2><div><ul>   <li>Update Gong CRM data every 1-15 minutes.<br>       This ensures Gong stores the most recent data, which improves the user experience.   </li>    <li><b>To view and filter:</b> Send files to Gong, and filter the data in Gong Reports etc.</li>    <li><b>To list mandatory fields:</b> Refer to \"/object/entities\" API (the Common CRM Object Fields section, and the list of fields for the four object types: Account, Contact, Deal and Lead).</li></ul></div><h2>The API Protocol</h2><p>The API protocol is based on REST guidelines whose endpoints start with https://api.gong.io/<b>v2/crm</b>.<br>e.g: https://api.gong.io/v2/crm/integration/new.</p><p>The payload is either a JSON object or, for API calls that upload lists of objects, line delimited JSON (see: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON' target='_blank'>JSON streaming</a>). <br>JSON objects should be UTF-8 encoded.</p><p>Each API call must include a Basic Authorization header as defined in the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview' target='_blank'>Authentication section</a>.</p><h2>Upload CRM Data to Gong</h2><h3>Supported CRM Objects</h3><p>The API supports these object types: Contact, Account, Deal, and Lead.</p><p>The following relationship between entities must exist*:</p><ol>    <li>A <b>deal</b> must be linked to a single <b>account</b>.</li>    <li>A <b>contact</b> must be linked to a single <b>account</b>.</li>    <li>A <b>deal</b> must have an owner who is a <b>user</b> in Gong.</li>    <li>A <b>converted lead</b> is expected to be converted into an <b>account</b> and/or a <b>deal</b> and/or a <b>contact</b>.</li></ol><p>* If your object hierarchy is different, contact Gong Support.</p><h2>Successful Integration Best Practices</h2><div><br>At the first deployment:<ul>    <li>Send all the CRM data in your system except for deleted entities.</li></ul>After the first deployment:<ul>    <li>Send changes (including deleted entities) every 1-15 minutes.</li></ul>Update Gong regularly:<ul>    <li>Gong monitors the liveliness of the integration, so send empty lists even if no changes occurred from the previous time.</li></ul></div><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>The following steps will guide you through creating a successful integration:</p><ol>    <li>Generate an API Key via Gong API Main Page, then create Base64 Token from the provided Access Key and Access Key Secret as explained in <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview' target='_blank'>Authentication</a>. The Base64 Token must be set in the \"Authorization\" header of every API call.</li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#put-/v2/crm/integration/new' target='_blank'>Register a Generic CRM integration API</a> to create a new integration in Gong with your CRM. The received \"integrationId\" is required for every subsequent API call.</li>    <li>Create users via the Team Members Page. Each user <b>must be set</b> to \"Record web conferences\" or \"Import calls\".</li>    <li>Upload users via the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/crm/object/entities' target='_blank'>Upload CRM objects API</a> (/v2/crm/object/entities?objectType=BUSINESS_USER) to map between users from your CRM and the users you created in Gong. The mapping is based on the user's email address.</li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/crm/object/schema' target='_blank'>Upload Object Schema API</a> to upload schema of any additional field that you want to send when uploading CRM objects. An additional field is any field which is not defined in the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/crm/object/entities' target='_blank'>Upload CRM objects API</a>.<br>    If you are not going to send additional fields, you can skip this step.    </li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/crm/object/entities' target='_blank'>Upload CRM objects API</a> (/v2/crm/object/entities?objectType=STAGE) to upload a list of all available stages from your CRM.</li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/crm/object/entities' target='_blank'>Upload CRM objects API</a> to upload CRM objects into Gong in the following order: Account, Contact, Deal, Lead. The order is important for correct processing of the CRM objects in Gong, since there are dependencies between the objects. For example, a Contact is linked to an Account via the \"accountId\" field.</li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#get-/v2/crm/request-status' target='_blank'>Get Request Status API</a> to follow the status of the upload objects request and verify there are no errors. A status of <span class='public-api-info'>DONE</span> indicates that there are no parsing errors such as missing mandatory fields, malformed dates, etc. and that the uploaded objects stored successfully in Raw Storage.</li>    <li>Call the <a href='https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#get-/v2/crm/object/list' target='_blank'>Get CRM objects API</a> to verify that the uploaded objects were successfully processed from Raw Storage into Gong's Main Database.
